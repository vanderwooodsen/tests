# Tests and Quizzes

This is the project I did for [Hackbright academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com/) prep course.
It can run multiple choice quizzes defined in a special format and give different results based on the accumulated points.

The code itself is in the `main.py` file while the test data is in functions defined in additional files.
